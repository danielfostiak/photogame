# Photo-game, a React.js app

This project was made while teaching my students how to code using React.js. It is a simple game where you are given an image and must try to match it to an altered version by editing characteristics via sliders.
The project uses only React.js for front-end and utilises the Daisy UI library built on top of Tailwind CSS.
## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Test it out

A live demo can be found at https://photogame.vercel.app
